Tree is a Non-Linear Data Structure.

Tree has nodes & edges. Edges connect 2 nodes.

If n nodes are present, n-1 edges are present in the tree.

Degree of node = number of direct children.

Degree of tree = highest degree of node present within the tree.

Binary Tree = Maximum 2 children possible.

Types of Binary Tree:
    
    1. Full Binary Tree (Strict Binary tree) : either 2 or 0 children.

    2. Perfect Binary Tree : All internal nodes have 2 children + All leaf nodes are on same level.

    3. Complete Binary Tree : All levels are completely filled (except possibly the last level) + last level (if incomplete) is left aligned.

    4. Degenerate Tree : Every parent node has exactly 1 child (except leaf node).
   
    5. Skewed trees : All elements are to the right or the left.
