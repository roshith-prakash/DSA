Tree is a Non-Linear Data Structure.

Tree has nodes & edges. Edges connect 2 nodes.

If n nodes are present, n-1 edges are present in the tree.

Degree of node = number of direct children.

Degree of tree = highest degree of node present within the tree.

Binary Tree = Maximum 2 children possible.

Types of Binary Tree:
<ol>
<li>Full Binary Tree (Strict Binary tree) : either 2 or 0 children.</li>

<li>Perfect Binary Tree : All internal nodes have 2 children + All leaf nodes are on same level.</li>

<li>Complete Binary Tree : All levels are completely filled (except possibly the last level) + last level (if incomplete) is left aligned.</li>

<li>Degenerate Tree : Every parent node has exactly 1 child (except leaf node).</li>
   
<li>Skewed trees : All elements are to the right or the left.</li>

</ol>
