Binary Search Tree (BST) is a type of binary tree.

Properties of BST: 
<ol>
    <li>All nodes of left subtree are smaller.</li>
    <li>All nodes of right subtree are larger.</li>
    <li>Left & right subtrees are both BST.</li>
    <li>No duplicate nodes are present in the tree. (Node with same value)</li>
    <li>InOrder Traversal of a BST gives a ascending sorted array.</li>
<ol>

Problems Added:
<ol>
    <li>Kth Smallest element in BST</li>
    <li>Inorder predecessor and successor of element in BST</li>
    <li>Least common ancestor of two elements in BST</li>
</ol>
