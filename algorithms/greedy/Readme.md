Greedy algorithms are a class of algorithms that make a series of choices by always selecting the best option available at the current step, without reconsidering previous decisions. The key idea is to choose the locally optimal solution at each stage with the hope that this approach leads to a globally optimal solution. Greedy algorithms are often simple and efficient, but they only work correctly for problems that have the "greedy choice property" and exhibit optimal substructure. Examples include algorithms for shortest paths, minimum spanning trees, and certain scheduling and optimization problems.
