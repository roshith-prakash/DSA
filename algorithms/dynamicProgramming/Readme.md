Dynamic Programming is an algorithmic technique used to solve problems by breaking them down into overlapping subproblems and solving each subproblem just once, storing the results for future use. It relies on the principle of optimal substructure, where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. DP is especially useful for optimization problems where naive recursion would result in redundant computations, making it efficient and powerful for tasks like sequence alignment, shortest paths, and resource allocation.
